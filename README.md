# Better Impact Notifier & Workflow Dashboard

A complete automated notification system and public-facing (but encrypted) workflow dashboard for managing Kwinana volunteer applications via the Better Impact API.

## Features

- **Automated Polling:** Checks Better Impact every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions. *(Note: The frequency is set to 30 mins because GitHub Actions minutes are completely free while the repository is public. The repository must remain public in order to host the dashboard on GitHub Pages for free)*
- **Immediate Alerts:** Sends an email to the supervisor immediately when a Registration Form is signed or an induction date is entered.
- **Daily Digest:** Sends a consolidated email at 8:00 AM (AWST) outlining non-critical profile changes and flagging **Stalled Workflows** (e.g. pending HR inductions after passing an interview).
- **Live Workflow Dashboard:** A slick frontend web dashboard hosted for free on GitHub Pages that displays the volunteer pipeline (New Applications, Awaiting HR, Awaiting Site Induction) along with recent activity lists.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Because free GitHub Pages requires a public repository, **all volunteer data is secured using AES-256-GCM encryption**. The Python script encrypts the state and dashboard payloads in the cloud, and the website prompts you for a password to decrypt the data locally in your browser. Nothing readable is ever saved in the repository.

## Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Add Secrets to GitHub

In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** and add the following:

| Secret Name        | Purpose                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BI_API_USERNAME`  | Your Better Impact API key username                                                       |
| `BI_API_PASSWORD`  | Your Better Impact API key password                                                       |
| `SMTP_HOST`        | Your mail server (e.g., `smtp.office365.com`)                                             |
| `SMTP_PORT`        | Usually `587` for TLS                                                                     |
| `SMTP_USERNAME`    | The email address sending the notification                                                |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD`    | Password for the sender email address                                                     |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL`     | The supervisor's email address receiving the alerts                                       |
| `STATE_PASSWORD`   | **CRITICAL:** A secure password used to AES-encrypt all tracked data in the repository.   |

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions Permissions

Since the script needs to update its tracking state:
1. Go to **Settings → Actions → General**.
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions** and select **Read and write permissions**.
3. Check the box to allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests.

### Step 3: Enable the GitHub Pages Dashboard

To view the frontend dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set the Source to **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Set the branch to `main` and the folder to `/docs`.
4. Click Save. Your dashboard will be accessible at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Security & Client-Side Decryption

Because GitHub Pages requires public repositories on free accounts, pushing volunteer names to an unencrypted `state.json` is a privacy violation. 

To solve this:
1. **GitHub Actions** reads your `STATE_PASSWORD` and encrypts both `state.json` and `docs/dashboard.json` into unreadable cyphertext.
2. **The Dashboard** intercepts the network request for `dashboard.json`, prompts the user for the password, and uses the browser's native **Web Crypto API** to decrypt the data on the fly.
3. Passwords are saved temporarily via `sessionStorage` to allow page reloads without entering the password again.

No plaintext PII (Personally Identifiable Information) touches the GitHub repository files.

## Monitored Fields

The script currently explicitly monitors these four Better Impact custom fields:
- `Registration Form - Sign`
- `Supervisor Interview Outcome`
- `HR Induction Date`
- `Site Induction Date`

If these fields need to be adapted, you can update the constants at the very top of `poll_better_impact.py`.

## Stopping or Pausing the Script

If you need to stop notifications momentarily without destroying the repository:
1. Go to **Actions → Better Impact Induction Notifier**.
2. Click the `...` menu on the right and hit **Disable workflow**.
